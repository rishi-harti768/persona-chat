# Assignment 01 — Persona-Based AI Chatbot

### Prompt Engineering | Scaler Academy

---

## Overview

You will build a working persona-based AI chatbot that lets users have real conversations with three Scaler/InterviewBit personalities — Anshuman Singh, Kshitij Mishra, and Abhimanyu Saxena. Every concept taught in the lecture must be applied inside this single application.

This is not a theoretical exercise. You will write real system prompts, call a real LLM API, and ship a working product.

---

## The Three Personas

You must build and maintain three separate system prompts, one for each persona. Do your research — watch their talks, read their LinkedIn posts, Whatsapp Messages & Class Tutorials. The richer your research, the more authentic your prompt.

---

### Persona 1 — Anshuman Singh

### Persona 2 — Abhimanyu Saxena

### Persona 3 — Kshitij Mishra

## System Prompt Requirements

Each system prompt must include all of the following:

1. **Persona description** — Who is this person? Their background, values, and communication style in detail.
2. **Few-shot examples** — Minimum 3 example user questions with ideal persona-style answers embedded directly in the system prompt.
3. **Chain-of-Thought instruction** — Tell the model to reason step-by-step internally before delivering its answer.
4. **Output instruction** — Specify the format and length of the response (e.g., 4–5 sentences, end with a question).
5. **Constraints** — What the persona should never do.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- A clean chat interface with a persona switcher (tabs or buttons) for all three personalities.
- When the persona is switched, the system prompt changes and the conversation resets.
- The active persona must be clearly visible in the UI at all times.
- Suggestion chips (quick-start questions) per persona.
- Typing indicator while the API call is in progress.
- Responsive — must work on mobile and desktop.

### Backend / API

- API key must be stored in an environment variable — never hardcoded in source code.
- Each persona must have its own system prompt passed correctly in the API call.
- Handle API errors gracefully — show a user-friendly message if the call fails.

### Tech Stack

You are free to use any stack you're comfortable with.

## Marking Scheme — Total: 10 Points

|  #  |           Criterion            | Marks |                                                                                      What We Look For                                                                                       |
| :-: | :----------------------------: | :---: | :-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|  1  |     **GitHub Repository**      |   2   |                                     Clean repo structure, `.env.example` present, no API keys committed, clear README with setup steps and screenshots.                                     |
|  2  |  **Live Project (Deployed)**   |   2   |                               The app is live and accessible via a public URL (Vercel, Netlify, Railway, or similar). Persona switching works in production.                                |
|  3  |      **Frontend Quality**      |   2   |                         The UI is clean, intuitive, and functional. A personal switcher works. Suggestion chips present. Typing indicator present. Mobile-friendly.                         |
|  4  |  **Backend & Prompt Quality**  |   2   | API is correctly wired. Each persona has a distinct, well-researched system prompt with few-shot examples, CoT instruction, and constraints. The bot genuinely sounds like the real person. |
|  5  | **Documentation & Reflection** |   2   |    `prompts.md` file in the repo with all three system prompts annotated. 300–500 word reflection covering: what worked, what the GIGO principle taught you, and what you would improve.    |

## Submission Checklist

Before submitting, verify every item below:

- [ ] GitHub repo is public and link is shared.
- [ ] Repo contains a `README.md` with setup instructions and a deployed link.
- [ ] Repo contains a `prompts.md` with all three system prompts + inline comments.
- [ ] Repo contains a `reflection.md` (300–500 words).
- [ ] `.env.example` file is present; no real API key is committed anywhere.
- [ ] App is deployed and live — not just running locally.
- [ ] All three personas are working in the live app.
- [ ] Persona switching resets the conversation correctly.
- [ ] App handles API errors without crashing.
- [ ] UI is mobile-responsive.

## What Good Looks Like

**A high-scoring submission will:**

- Have system prompts so well-crafted that a person familiar with Anshuman, Kshitij, or Abhimanyu would recognize them.
- Show clear evidence of research — references to real things the person has said, built, or believes.
- Have a clean, professional UI that feels like something you'd actually want to use.
- Have a live deployed link that works without setup on the evaluator's machine.
- Include a `prompts.md` that reads like a product decision document — explaining why each prompt choice was made, not just what was written.

**A low-scoring submission will:**

- Have generic system prompts like "You are Anshuman Singh, be helpful and friendly" — this is a GIGO failure.
- Have API keys hardcoded or committed to the repo.
- Have no deployed link — only a local demo.
- Have no documentation or a `README.md` that just says "Run `npm start`".

## Important Notes

- Research is part of the assignment. You are expected to spend time understanding each persona before writing a single line of their system prompt.
- GIGO applies to you too. If you put lazy input into your system prompt, you will get lazy output from the LLM. There are no shortcuts.
- The personas are real people. Represent them fairly and professionally. Do not put words in their mouths that contradict their known public positions.
- Working beats pretty. A functional app with great prompts and a basic UI scores higher than a beautiful app with a broken or shallow chatbot.
